# TALENTFLOW üöÄ

A modern, front-end-only recruitment platform built with React and TypeScript.

**Live Demo**: [https://mdsibtain-talentflow-app.vercel.app](https://mdsibtain-talentflow-app.vercel.app)


TalentFlow is a comprehensive front-end recruitment platform that enables HR teams to manage job postings, track candidates through a hiring pipeline, and build dynamic skill assessments ‚Äî all without a real backend.

> **Note:** This is a front-end only application. The "backend" is fully simulated in the browser using Mock Service Worker to intercept API requests and IndexedDB to persist data between sessions.

## üéØ Core Features

### üíº Jobs Board
- **Server-like Filtering & Pagination:** The jobs list is fully filterable by status (Active, Archived) and searchable by title or tags. All state is managed via URL parameters for shareable links.
- **Create & Edit Jobs:** Modal-driven interface for creating and editing jobs, powered by React Hook Form for robust validation (e.g., required title).
- **Unique Slug Generation:** The mock API automatically ensures all job slugs are unique, appending a number if a conflict exists.
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Job cards can be reordered with a smooth drag-and-drop interface, featuring optimistic UI updates and a simulated rollback on API failure.
- **Archive & Restore:** Jobs can be archived to hide them from the main view and later restored.
- **Deep Linking:** Each job has a unique, shareable URL (e.g., `/jobs/senior-frontend-engineer-react`).

### üë• Candidate Management
- **High-Performance Virtualized List:** The main candidates list efficiently renders 1000+ seeded candidates using `@tanstack/react-virtual`, ensuring a smooth user experience.
- **Client & Server-Side Filtering:** Instant client-side searching by name/email and server-like filtering by hiring stage.
- **Kanban Pipeline:** A per-job, drag-and-drop Kanban board to visually manage and move candidates between stages (applied, screen, tech, etc.).
- **Detailed Candidate Profiles:** Each candidate has a profile page showing their summary, the job they applied for, and a complete timeline of their stage changes and any associated notes.
- **Notes with @mentions:** Users can add notes to a candidate's timeline. The form supports `@mentions` with suggestions and renders them with special styling.
- **Add New Candidates:** A dedicated flow allows users to add new candidates to a specific job or to the general candidate pool, with email uniqueness validation.

### üìù Dynamic Assessments
- **Per-Job Assessment Builder:** A powerful, two-pane interface for creating custom assessments for each job.
- **Live Preview:** As questions are added and configured on the left, a fully interactive, live preview of the form is rendered on the right.
- **Rich Question Types:** Supports single-choice, multi-choice, short text, long text, numeric, and a file upload stub.
- **Robust Validation Rules:** The builder allows setting rules like required, min/max range for numbers, and maxLength for text fields. The live preview enforces these rules with real-time feedback.
- **Conditional Logic:** Questions can be configured to appear only if a previous question was answered with a specific value.
- **Local Persistence:** The state of an assessment being built is saved to `localStorage`, preventing loss of work on refresh. Finalized assessments are saved to the IndexedDB database.
- **Seeded Examples:** The application seeds three pre-built assessments for key jobs to demonstrate the full capabilities of the builder.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Decisions

### State Management
The application's state management is intentionally separated into distinct categories, using the best tool for each job:

- **Server State:** All asynchronous operations (fetching/updating data) are managed by TanStack Query. This provides a robust, declarative way to handle loading states, errors, caching, and mutations, keeping components clean and focused on UI.
- **Form State:** Complex forms like the Job Editor and Assessment Builder are handled by React Hook Form for high performance and simplified validation.
- **URL State:** Filters, pagination, and search queries are stored in the URL using React Router's `useSearchParams`. This makes the application's state shareable and persistent across refreshes.
- **UI State:** Simple, local component state (e.g., modal visibility) is managed with the standard `useState` hook.

### API & Data Persistence
The core of the application simulates a real-world architecture locally:

- **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** acts as the "Network Layer." It intercepts `fetch` requests at the network level, allowing the application code (services, hooks) to be written as if it were communicating with a real REST API.
- **Dexie.js (IndexedDB)** acts as the persistent "Database." MSW handlers read from and write through the IndexedDB, ensuring data persists between sessions. This architecture separates the API simulation from the data storage.
- **Artificial Latency & Failures:** All mock API endpoints include a random artificial latency (200‚Äì1200ms) and a 5‚Äì10% chance of failure on write operations to simulate real-world conditions and test optimistic UI rollbacks.

### Performance
- **Virtualization:** The candidates list uses `@tanstack/react-virtual` to ensure smooth scrolling and high performance even with thousands of items.
- **Debouncing:** Search inputs on list pages use a debounced handler to prevent excessive API calls while the user types.

## üìù Issues & Technical Decisions

This section documents key technical challenges I encountered during development and the decisions I made to address them.

### 1. Kanban Card Position on Drop
- **Issue:** When dragging a candidate card to a new column on the Kanban board, the card correctly updated its stage but visually jumped to the end of the list on drop, instead of staying where I dropped it.  
- **Root Cause Analysis:** I traced this to a race condition between the optimistic UI update managed by `dnd-kit` and the cache invalidation from TanStack Query after the API call succeeded. Since the Candidate data model didn‚Äôt have a dedicated `order` field, the "true" order was only known by the database.  
- **Decision & Trade-off:** I decided to prioritize core functionality (successful stage change + smooth drag-and-drop UX) over perfect positional persistence. The stage assignment is always correct, even if the position resets. A future improvement would be to add an `order` field and a dedicated API call to update it.

### 2. Note Modal Timing After Drag
- **Issue:** The modal for adding a note after moving a candidate between columns would sometimes fail to appear on the first attempt.  
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Rapid state changes and component re-renders triggered by the drag-end event interfered with the modal‚Äôs mounting lifecycle.  
- **Solution:** I introduced a small `setTimeout` delay (200ms) before setting the modal‚Äôs `isOpen` state. This gave the drag-and-drop animation and state updates enough time to settle, so the modal mounted reliably.  

---

### 3. Reordering a Paginated List
- **Challenge:** Implementing drag-and-drop reordering for jobs across multiple paginated pages is complex ‚Äî it would mean fetching all data, managing heavy client-side state, and syncing it back with server pagination.  
- **Decision & Workaround:** Instead of over-engineering, I gave users a practical UX workaround: the "Per Page" filter lets them select a high number (e.g., 30) to show all jobs on a single view. This way, reordering works seamlessly without cross-page state management complexity.  

---

### 4. The "Unexpected token '<'" Error
- **Issue:** Occasionally the app crashed with `Unexpected token '<'... <!doctype...` when left idle in development or on deployment.  
- **Root Cause Analysis:** This happened because the fetch client was designed to strictly receive `application/json` from API endpoints. In certain cases, it instead received the full HTML document of the application. When the app tried to parse this HTML (`<!doctype html>...`) as JSON, it crashed. A similar race condition involving Vite‚Äôs Hot Module Replacement also caused the same error during development.  
- **Solution:** In `src/api/client.ts`, I made the fetch wrapper defensive. It now inspects the `Content-Type` header, and if the response is `text/html` (or anything non-JSON), it throws a controlled error (e.g., "MSW interception failed..."). This prevented crashes and let TanStack Query handle errors gracefully, so the UI now shows proper error messages instead of breaking.  

---

### 5. Synchronized Horizontal Scrollbars
- **Challenge:** On the wide Kanban board, I wanted a second scrollbar at the top, synchronized with the main one at the bottom. Browsers don‚Äôt support this natively.  
- **Solution:** I attached `useRef` hooks to both scrollable containers and added `onScroll` listeners. Whenever one scrollbar moved, I programmatically set the other‚Äôs `scrollLeft`. This gave a smooth, intuitive dual-scrollbar experience.  

---

### 6. Styling System & Specificity
- **Challenge:** While `shadcn/ui` + Tailwind CSS worked great, I hit conflicts between the library‚Äôs reset classes (like `border-0`) and my glassmorphism design, which relied on visible borders.  
- **Decision:** I manually audited the affected components and overrode or removed conflicting default classes. I chose to make sure my custom design system always took priority, keeping the UI consistent and polished.
